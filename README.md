So this is basically one of my first landing page projects made from a free psd layout by WEBDESIGNERDEPOT STAFF.
It's responsible on every resolution above 320 px wide. I made a single page navigation through the menu and a slider for user reviews. I decided not to use any of third party slider APIs and just wrote my own one with JavaScript. It is pretty much responsive aswell, but it still raw. You have to reload the page in order to resize slider width. Though it still works on pretty much every device.
